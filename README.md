# spreadcoin-android-app
Hi Fellow Spreaders!

I would like to introduce to Spreadcoin community an Android app called Spreadcoin, development is currently at a very early stage, letâ€™s call it pre-alpha version.

The app is already capable of acting as the ecosystem "barometer", it shows all the crucial data - live!

New features to come are, wallet balance check (based on a provided Spreadcoin address) and how much is the wallet worth in a chosen fiat, crucial set of features for a potential & an existing investor.

All data to be shown is near to real-time.

Tested app instance did not drain the battery, and consumed ~ 1 kb/hour of internet traffic.

Mobile Spreadcoin wallet features are to come later.

Working on bringing the app to Google Play.

Android 4.0 and up is required (covering the most of potential users).

Current app functionality is delivered in a form of a widget.
